3. **Use The Jobs Board** — All job postings must be posted through the jobs board at <https://techmasters.chat/jobs>. No job may be posted that involves any illegal activity in the jurisdiction in which the job is located. Job templates must be closely followed, otherwise they may get closed.
4. **Be Friendly and Respectful** — No harassment, hate speech, racism, sexism, malicious trolling, etc. You may be banned immediately and without warning or recourse. Additionally, be aware we have an incredibly varied user base when it comes to knowledge, so please be patient and help each other.
