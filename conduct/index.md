#### Welcome to the TechMasters Community!

As part of the TechMasters community’s commitment to making the TechMasters Slack (the "Slack") a great place to meet and interact with other professionals around the world, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct. Your commitment to this Code of Conduct in all chat areas, social media discussions, and other web properties associated with TechMasters helps create a positive experience for all the community’s users.

#### Respect Others

We encourage everyone to treat each other with mutual respect. Do not use the Slack to threaten, harass, stalk, or abuse others participating in these services.

TechMasters reserves the right to remove messages that advocate or encourage expressions of violence, bigotry, racism, hatred, or profanity.

TechMasters may remove messages and files that are deemed inappropriate, offensive or that violate this Code of Conduct. TechMasters may also eject or ban any user from the Slack who behaves in a manner deemed inappropriate, offensive or who violates this Code of Conduct.

#### Keep It Legal

TechMasters does not allow any illegal activities. You cannot use the Slack to publish, post, distribute, or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene, or other unlawful material or information, specifically, but not limited to, child pornography, bestiality, and incest. Also, you may not use the Slack for discussions relating to the trading or dissemination of illegal drugs.

You may not use the Slack for the purpose of linking to external sites that violate this Code of Conduct.

Do not upload files or post messages that contain photos, music, software or other material protected by intellectual property laws, rights of privacy or publicity or any other applicable law unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents. TechMasters is not responsible for any use of anything you say or post.

Do not post any materials (including software and other information) that could harm (or is designed to harm) other users' computers or would allow others to inappropriately access software or Web sites.

Do not attempt to abuse this Slack via any attempts at data mining or scraping. Requests for API access or the use of any tools, plugins, or scripts for the purposes of acquiring email addresses, names, usernames, or any other user information for export are strictly forbidden.

#### Play Nice

TechMasters does not tolerate disruptive activity online, such as persistent off-topic comments and postings or statements that incite others to violate this Code of Conduct or participate in illegal activities. Our Slack’s users want to chat and post in our Slack in a positive environment.

TechMasters does not allow the posting of destructive features, use of computer programs that contain such features, or access to any content that contains destructive features such as: viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or bots for the use of flooding channels with spam or other inappropriate material, showing multiple screens, and other activities that can be disruptive to online communication.

Falsely impersonating a TechMasters organizer, administrator, or any other person with the intent to mislead or cause harm to others is forbidden.

#### Dealing With Spam (Don't Spam)

Although not explicitly called out in this CoC, we ask that all moderators be aware of and intervene in the case of spam.

Please don't "spam" through our Slack as none of our users like it. Spam is a post or a series of posts where the content is primarily solicitation, nonsense, overly short/long, or off-topic. Posts, where the content is not hand-crafted or is too generic/useless, may also be considered spam. Spam accounts are user accounts which post spam content or are created in series to secure access to the site and its privileges, or both. Spam posts and accounts may be automated or manual.

We realize spam can be hard to define in some cases, so we will rely on the community or moderators to identify and flag it and handle it appropriately. Obvious spam posts should be promptly deleted; non-obvious spam may be flagged for review. Users are encouraged to flag posts as spam to help bring them to a moderator’s attention.

Not all spam posts are by spam users. For example, a legitimate user account may be compromised. If a moderator notices a reputable user account posting spam, the spam post(s) should be deleted immediately, and the user notified. If spam posts continue, the account may be suspended until the user can regain control of their account.

Commercial content is allowed if relevant to answering a question or keeping in line with a topic. Additionally, TechMasters has a couple of channels dedicated to specific, relevant, commercial content. These channels include `#deals` for posting deal-related content (sales, coupons, etc.), `#showcase` where users can feature their own start-ups and services to solicit feedback, and `#events` to share related community events.

TechMasters reserves the right to delete spam content as well as banning a user at any time, without notice, from the Slack for spamming. Some examples of spam include, but are not limited to:

- Posting the same message to more than 1 channel.
- Sharing shortened links.
- Sharing your own email in a public channel.
- Requesting members to fill a feedback form without consulting an admin prior to posting.
- Poaching members to join your community.

When in doubt, consult one of the admins for case-by-case advice.

#### Recruit Invisibly and Respectfully

While we understand that a technology-based group might be an ideal recruiting pool, our goal with this group is to provide a safe-haven for the free-sharing of knowledge and ideas among technology professionals, so it is with that ideal that we encourage any potential recruiters to tread lightly. For the recruiters who join this slack, they should additionally keep the following conditions in mind:

* Do not private message other members unless (a) that other member has posted a job request in #jobs or #freelance, (b) that other member has reached out directly to the recruiter via a private message or a direct response in a channel, or (c) that other member has previously publicly stated that they welcome contact from recruiters and job posters.
* Do not retain membership here solely for the purpose of headhunting. You are expected to contribute to any relevant conversation. This will have the added benefit of providing you with presence and authority for whoever you may be representing and recruiting for.
* Under no circumstances are recruiters (or any user) allowed to datamine. Do not request API access or build or use any tools for the purposes of scraping names, email addresses, or any other user information.

#### Take It Personally

The Slack may be used to provide supplemental information regarding your own business (provided you do not use spam to provide this information); however, the Slack is not designed to be used as the primary mechanism for operating your business or providing core information about your business.

#### Accept Responsibility

You are responsible and liable for all your activities while participating in the Slack. Remember, you are responsible for anything you say or post and for protecting your own computer system. We recommend you install both an anti-virus solution and an anti-malware solution on your computer, and that you browse the web with a suitable ad-blocking extension.

Our Slack is not designed as the primary place to store any materials; you are responsible for creating backups of materials you post to to the Slack such as photos or documents. TechMasters is not responsible for loss of, access to, or deletion or alteration of any materials included on the Slack.

TechMasters reserves the right to remove at any time, without notice, any posting to the Slack.

Some users may post external website links on the Slack. Please be advised that TechMasters is not responsible for any of the content on these linked websites.

You are responsible for any actions you may take based on advice or information you receive online. Use your own good judgment when evaluating information provided through this Slack or any other such services, remember that the information provided could be from people at any age and experience level. The decision to conduct transactions with anyone is your own and you should conduct your own research prior to making any decisions.

#### Uphold the Code

In helping to make our Slack a great place to meet, chat and exchange information, you must do your part to uphold this Code of Conduct.

TechMasters also reserves our right to amend or change the Code of Conduct at any time without notice. You agree to periodically review this document to ensure you are doing your part.

TechMasters is not obligated to send users or hosts a warning before deleting any content.

#### Protect Your Privacy

We caution you against giving out personally identifiable information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, names and addresses, telephone numbers, driver license numbers) to strangers online, which may be used for illegal or harmful purposes.

Some personal information you provide to the Slack may be stored outside of the country in which you reside.

Be aware that some channels have a publicly-accessible and searchable record of all message activity at [http://techmasters.slackarchive.io](http://techmasters.slackarchive.io/). These channels are #business, #freelance, #general, #programming, and #technology. Therefore it is advisable to avoid sharing personally-identifiable information, or information you would not want available outside the confines of the Slack.

Slack provides the ability for you to protect your account with Two-Factor Authentication ("2FA"), which is a responsible step in protecting your privacy and preventing abuse of and impersonation with your account. You may enable 2FA at [https://techmasters.slack.com/account/settings](https://techmasters.slack.com/account/settings).
